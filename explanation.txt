For my Hangman game, I used a while loop to keep the main game running until the player either wins or loses, and another loop so you can play multiple rounds with restarting. I used an array to hold a list of words and the Random class to pick one each round. For string stuff, I turned the chosen word into underscores and revealed the letters as you guessed them, while also keeping track of letters that were already guessed so you don't repeat. I used if/else statements to check whether a guess was right or wrong and to handle win or lose situations. Overall, I just tried to make the game simple, clean, and actually fun to play.
